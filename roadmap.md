# Project Roadmap

## Project Structure
TODO: Improve the project structure
- Remove the module directory and add an api directory to the components directory
- Add an authentication directory for all auth files
- Pages and containers is kind of ambigious, think of a better structure for this too

## Future Implementations
- A Redux State manager instead of local component state
- Styled Components instead of css files
- Fix some of the missing files (favico and assets OR images)

## API
- Add logout functionality
- Improve the fetch API (also use the fetch API instead of xhr in other components)
